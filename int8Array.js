/**
 * The Int8Array typed array represents an array of twos-complement 8-bit signed integers. 
 * The contents are initialized to 0. Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, 
 * or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation).
 */

 /**
  * Int8Array just include integer which is twos-complement 8-bit signed:只能存储二进制8bit的整数
  * capacity is initialized and cannot change after the array is inited:容量在初始化之后不能发生更改
